hello welcome on my version of Simon

the rules of the game :

as long as the player finds the number sequence the game continues

as the value is different the game stops.

I did this project as part of the python training

I learned how to make a class diagram, Declare and use objects in his program,

Organize his program into objects, Make objects interact with each other,

Manage the realization of a project in time
